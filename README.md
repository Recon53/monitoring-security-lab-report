# Monitoring & Security Lab: Ubuntu and Windows

## Overview
This project documents a hands-on monitoring and security lab performed using both **Ubuntu Linux** and **Microsoft Windows**.

The objective of this lab was to learn how operating systems:

- Monitor performance and activity  
- Detect suspicious behavior  
- Protect files from malware such as ransomware  

The work includes screenshots, explanations, and analysis showing how system tools reveal what is happening “behind the scenes”.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives
- Monitor system performance and activity  
- Review logs and security tools  
- Detect suspicious or abnormal behavior  
- Understand ransomware behavior and defenses  
- Compare baseline activity versus ransomware activity  

---

## 🐧 Ubuntu Section — Tools Used
- `top` and `htop` process monitoring  
- `journalctl` log analysis  
- Disk and memory usage  
- Service management (`systemctl`)  
- Antivirus and intrusion protection (ClamAV + Fail2ban)  
- File permissions and access control  

---

## 🪟 Windows Section — Topics Covered
- Task Manager performance monitoring  
- PowerShell process monitoring  
- Viewing Windows services  
- SafeSim ransomware simulation

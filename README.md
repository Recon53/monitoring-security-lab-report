## Overview
This project documents a hands-on monitoring and security lab performed using both **Ubuntu Linux** and **Microsoft Windows**.

The objective of this lab was to learn how operating systems:

- Monitor performance and activity  
- Detect suspicious behavior  
- Protect files from malware such as ransomware  

The work includes screenshots, explanations, and analysis showing how system tools reveal what is happening “behind the scenes”.
